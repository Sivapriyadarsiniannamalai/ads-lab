III,b, Display future leap years from current year to a final year entered by user using a functions:


def count_leap_years(start_year, end_year):
    count = 0
    leap_years = []
    for year in range(start_year, end_year + 1):
        if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
            count += 1
            leap_years.append(year)
    return count, leap_years
start_year = int(input("Enter the start year: "))
end_year = int(input("Enter the end year: "))
leap_year_count, leap_years = count_leap_years(start_year, end_year)
print(f"Total leap years between {start_year} and {end_year}: {leap_year_count}")
print("Leap years:", leap_years)



output:

Enter the start year: 2024
